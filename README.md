# CourseraGettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject


Tanja Molle


The run_analysis.R script downloads the Data a smartphone produced while the holder did different tasks. These tasks include walking up-/downstairs and lying. 
It then discards several columns to only keep mean values and standard deviations. The column names become more readable. At last it outputs a tidy data set 
to tidydata.txt. That includes the meanvalues for each participant and activities.


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables used in run_analysis

- 'run_analysis': runs the specified analysis on the project files.
